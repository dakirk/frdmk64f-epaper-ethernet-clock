# frdmk64f-epaper-ethernet-clock
This is the code for a FRDM-K64F-based clock, with a WaveShare 2.7-inch 3-color e-paper display and an NTP connection for time synchronization. 

It is based primarily on the NXP SDK, including the SPI drivers and LWIP for internet connectivity, and written using MCUXpresso. The display driver is based on WaveShare's Arduino driver, found [here](https://github.com/waveshare/e-Paper).
